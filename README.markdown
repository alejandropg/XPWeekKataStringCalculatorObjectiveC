# XPWeekKataStringCalculatorObjectiveC #

This proyect is the result of doing the String Calculator Kata (http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/) in Objective-C to the [XPWeek](http://xpweek.es/) 2011.

In the XPWeek 2011 I talked about how to do [TDD in Objective-C with OCUnit and OCMock](http://xpweek.es/?p=104).
